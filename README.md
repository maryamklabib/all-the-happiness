A twitter bot to make people happy.

## Setup Your Own
1. [Install node.js & npm](http://nodejs.org/download/).
2. Clone this repo.
3. Run `npm install` to download dependencies.
4. Open `index.js` and replace the values in the `config` object with your own.
5. [Create a twitter application](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new), grant it the necessary access, and generate your tokens/keys.
6. Deploy the bot to heroku (you can [use these instructions](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction) as a guide).
7. Keep it awake. Heroku puts apps to sleep if they're not being pinged. I used [Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com), they have a free tier and it can ping your server every 5 minutes eternally.
